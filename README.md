# Gestalt-Laws-in-Booking-Website
Web designers use various methods to attract user experience and perception, one of which 
is gestalt principles. The gestalt principles consist of several principles that describe how the 
human brain perceives visual information. This theory is shaped around five basic principles 
of figure-ground relationship, proximity, similarity, completion, continuity, and simplicity. The 
expectation in the Gestalt principles is the management of visual perception as desired and 
thus providing the user with an effective experience. We will examine whether the Gestalt 
principles have been used in the Booking.com application, whether this principle really 
affects our perception, which ones are used for what purpose, and we will examine these by 
experiencing.
